# Scientific Programming Toolkit

This is a repository of guides to set up a reasonble toolkit for working with research data on a unix-based server (or on a Mac).

This guide will work best if you are on a Mac. Many things will most likely work on Windows too (with [Windows Subsystems for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)) but have not been tested (since I only work on Mac).

Some basics:

* Whenever a code block contains code to be "run" that means entering the code in a terminal (the Mac app Terminal or iTerm (recommended) or in the Command Line on windows) and pressing Enter.
* On Windows, opening a command line can be done by pressing `Windows+R` and then writing `cmd` and pressing `ctrl+shift+enter` to get administrator privileges.

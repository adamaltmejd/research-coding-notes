# Basic terminal usage

A shell is a command line interface for talking to your computer. On *nix systems you can chose from a variety of shells, `Shell`, `Bash` and `ZSH` being the most common ones. I will be using `ZSH` but for all the commands in this intro any shell will work.

You execute a command by writing it and pressing <enter>. When you login to a shell you start in your home directory `~/`. Commands are often called with different instructions or options prefixed with dashes.

## First commands to learn

* `man <command>` shows you the help file for `<command>` so you can for example write `man ls` to learn about the command `ls`.
* `pwd` shows you the path of the directory you are currently in
* `ls` lists all files in the current directory. You can write `ls -a` to also show hidden files, or `ls -l` to show files in a neat list. `ls -h` shows file sizes in human readable formats. You can combine all these instructions by entering `ls -lah`.
* `cp <source> <target>` copies a source file to the target location
* `mv <source> <target>` moves a source file to the target location
* `rm <file>` removes a file
* `mkdir <directory>` make a new folder
* `cat <file>` prints the contents of a file

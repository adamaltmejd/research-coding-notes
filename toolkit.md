You will be spending lots of time on the command line if you follow this guide, so lets start by setting up a good set of tools for that. The very first thing I do on a new computer is to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by running:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Homebrew is an amazing package manager that maintains all your apps and programs that you will need. Sort of like the Mac App store just for a lot more stuff.

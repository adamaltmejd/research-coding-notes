# General advice

I often come back to this excellent guide by Gentzkow and Shapiro <https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf>. Recommended reading for everyone.

Kieran Healy has some [excellent resources on his website](https://kieranhealy.org/resources/). Especially ["The Plain Personâ€™s Guide to Plain Text Social Science"](https://plain-text.co) is worth a read.
